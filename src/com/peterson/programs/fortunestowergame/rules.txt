Welcome to Fortune's Tower!

This is a game of luck. A deck of 52 cards
is drawn from, adding to each row.
The goal of the game is to get as many points
is possible in a row before you cash out...
but be warned, as a Misfortune can occur.
A Misfortune happens when a card in a row has
the same card value as the one above it. However,
when a row has a knight card, the current row is immune
to a misfortune, and then there is a Gate Card.
The Gate Card is played when the first misfortune occurs, and is
used to replace the card that is causing the Misfortune,
trying to save the game.

The goal is to get as many points as possible on a row,
and if the last row is dealt without the Gate Card being used,
a jackpot occurs where your points equal the sum of all the card on
the board!

Good Luck!
